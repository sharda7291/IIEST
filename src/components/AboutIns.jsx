Considering the year of establishment, it is the 3rd engineering college in India but considering the year of graduation it is the 2nd oldest engineering college in India. In 1880, the college was shifted to its present campus at Shibpur, Howrah, and was christened the 'Government College, Howrah,' in the premises of Bishop's College. In 1921, the name of the college space was changed to 'Bengal Engineering College' (popularly known as B. E. College). The college celebrated its gala centenary function inaugurated by Dr. B. C. Roy on the 25th of December 1956 and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru graced its concluding session on 14th January 1957. In recognition of its service to the nation for 143 years of its existence with its well- organized infrastructure, the college was elevated to the status of a "Deemed University" in 1992 by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India on the recommendation of a UGC Expert Committee. In 2004, B.E. College (Deemed University) was converted into a full-fledged university by an act in the West Bengal Assembly and renamed as Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur. In March 2014, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur was taken over by the Government of India and it was converted into an Institute of National Importance through an act of parliament and was renamed as Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur.
